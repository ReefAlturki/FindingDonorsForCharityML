# Finding Donors for CharityML

## Project Overview
This is the first project for Introduction to Machine learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree provided by Udacity. In this project, I applied several supervised learning algorithms on the U.S. Census dataset to help a charity organization in finding donors.

## Installation
This project requires Python 2.7 and the following python libraries:
* NumPy
* Pandas
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn

You will need to have a software that runs and executes iPython Notebook.

## Code
This project template has been provided by Udacity. Some code has already been implemented, and I implemented additional functionality to successfully complete the project. The file named census.csv contains the dataset and the file named visuals.py is only for visualizing some graphs.

## Disclaimer
The solutions released in this project are only for reference purposes.
